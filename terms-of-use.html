        <p>Will these Terms ever change?</p>
        <p>
          We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may
          need to change along with our Services. We reserve the right to change
          the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will place a notice on our
          site located at www.mostdays.com, send you an email, and/or notify you
          by some other means.

        <p>
          If you don&rsquo;t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject
          them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the
          Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the
          Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
        </p>

          Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or
          modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and

        </p>
        <p>What are the basics of using Most Days Inc.?</p>
        <p>
          You may be required to sign up for an account, select a password and
          user name (&ldquo;Most Days Member ID&rdquo;), and provide us with
          certain information or data, such as your contact information. You
          promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated
          registration information about yourself. You may not select as your
          Most Days Member ID a name that you do not have the right to use, or
          another person&rsquo;s name with the intent to impersonate that
          person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our
          prior written permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, you may be able to access certain parts or features of
          the Services by using your account credentials from other services
          (each, a &ldquo;Third Party Account&rdquo;), such as those offered by
          Facebook. By using the Services through a Third Party Account, you
          permit us to access certain information from such account for use by
          the Services. You are ultimately in control of how much information is
          accessible to us and may exercise such control by adjusting your
          privacy settings on your Third Party Account.
        </p>
        <p>
          You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to
          form a binding contract (or if not, you&rsquo;ve received your
          parent&rsquo;s or guardian&rsquo;s permission to use the Services and
          have gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your
          behalf). If you&rsquo;re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an
          organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are
          authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization&rsquo;s or
          entity&rsquo;s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the
          references to &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; in these Terms,
          except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).
        </p>
        <p>
          You will only use the Services you obtain for your own internal,

          of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws
          that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by
          applicable laws, then you aren&rsquo;t authorized to use the Services.
          We can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t be responsible for your using the
          Services in a way that breaks the law.

          Days Member ID and account.

          <strong>
            Most Days Inc. does not offer medical advice or diagnoses, or engage
            in the practice of medicine. Our Services are not intended to be a
            substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment
            and are offered for informational and communicative purposes only.
            The Services are not intended to be, and must not be taken to be,
            the practice of medicine, nursing or pharmacy, or the provision of
            other healthcare advice by Most Days Inc.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The Services are not meant to diagnose or treat any conditions -
            only your medical professional can determine the right course of
            treatment for you and determine what is safe, appropriate and
            effective based on your needs. Reliance on any information provided
            by Most Days Inc. or in connection with the Services is solely at
            your own risk. You are solely responsible for any decisions or
            actions you take based on the information and materials available
            through the Services.

          <strong>
            You acknowledge that although some Content (defined below) may be
            provided by individuals in the medical profession, the provision of
            such Content does not create a medical professional/patient
            relationship between you and Most Days Inc. or between you and any
            other individual or entity, and does not constitute an opinion,
            medical advice, or diagnosis or treatment.
          </strong>
          &nbsp;Healthcare providers and patients should always obtain
          applicable diagnostic information from appropriate trusted sources.
          Healthcare providers should never withhold professional medical advice
          or delay in providing it because of something they have read in
          connection with our Services. Should any medical issue arise during
          your use of the Services, you should contact your health care provider
          immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the extent that, in addition to the Services you receive from Most
          Days, you receive medical care from another party, that medical care
          is separate from and unrelated to the Services. Most Days is not
          responsible or liable for any advice, course of treatment, diagnosis,
          or any other information, services, or products that you may obtain
          from unaffiliated third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any information you receive or obtain from using the Services is
          inconsistent with the medical advice of your physician, you should
          follow the advice of your physician. If you are being treated for any
          medical condition, or if you are taking any prescription medications
          or supplements, it is particularly important for you to seek
          professional medical advice from your health care provider before
          relying on any information or Content provided on or through the
          Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            THE SERVICES SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR EMERGENCY
            CARE. IF YOU HAVE A MEDICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCY, ARE THINKING
            ABOUT SUICIDE OR TAKING ACTIONS THAT MAY CAUSE HARM TO YOU OR TO
            OTHERS, YOU SHOULD SEEK EMERGENCY TREATMENT AT THE NEAREST EMERGENCY

              through the Services (including Routines, defined below) is your
              &ldquo;Member Submission&rdquo;. Some Member Submissions may be
              viewable by other members, as described below.&nbsp; You are
              solely responsible for all Member Submissions you contribute to
              the Services. You represent that all Member Submissions submitted

              You may post, upload, share, store or otherwise provide a list of
              habits to reach a health goal (each list, a
              &ldquo;Routine&rdquo;). Like all Member Submissions, you can keep
              private or share Routines with other members, as described below.

              name, image, biographical information, and likeness, in connection
              with the Service and advertising the Service. If you create and

              You agree that you will not post, upload, share, store, or
              otherwise provide through the Services any Member Submissions
              that: (i) infringe any third party&rsquo;s copyrights or other
              rights (e.g., trademark, privacy rights, etc.); (ii) contain
              sexually explicit content or pornography; (iii) contain hateful,
              defamatory, or discriminatory content or incite hatred against any

              or extreme violence; (vi) depict animal cruelty or extreme

              If you store a Member Submission in your own personal Most Days

              &ldquo;Limited Audience Member Submission&rdquo;), then you grant

            Paid Services. We charge members a fee for using the Services (the
            &ldquo;Paid Services&rdquo;). The Paid Services are offered on a
            sliding scale. When you sign up to be a member, you select the
            amount per month that you wish to pay for the Paid Services. If you
            cannot afford the Paid Services but wish to be a member, we may
            offer the Services to you at no charge, in our discretion. Please
            see our Member Pricing page at&nbsp;

            Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process
            of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these
            Terms. For example, some Paid Services will charge a fee for
            downloading or installing the Services through the App Store (as
            defined below) linked to your specific device. You agree to comply
            with, and your license to use our mobile application is conditioned
            upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions. Any
            refunds relating to the applications or inquiries regarding refunds
            relating to the applications shall be handled solely by the
            applicable App Store in accordance with such App Store&rsquo;s terms
            and conditions.

          <li>
            Billing. We use a third-party payment processor (the &ldquo;Payment
            Processor&rdquo;) to bill you through a payment account linked to
            your account on the Services (your &ldquo;Billing Account&rdquo;)
            for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be
            subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment
            Processor in addition to these Terms. Currently, we use Stripe, Inc.
            as our Payment Processor. You can access Stripe&rsquo;s Terms of

            . We are not responsible for any error by, or other acts or
            omissions of, the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid
            Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all
            charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid
            Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you
            authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen
            payment provider (your &ldquo;Payment Method&rdquo;). You agree to
            make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the
            right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor
            makes even if it has already requested or received payment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Payment Method. The terms of your payment will be based on your
            Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and
            the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of
            your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do
            not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on
            your Billing Account upon demand.
          </li>
          <li>
            Recurring Billing. Some of the Paid Services may consist of an
            initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by
            recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a
            recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an
            initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility
            for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT
            PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM
            YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED
            BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE
            YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED
            BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR
            CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO ACCOUNT SETTINGS.
          </li>
          <li>
            Current Information Required. YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND
            ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY
            UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT,
            COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT
            CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY
            NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS
            CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A
            POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR
            USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN
            BE MADE AT ACCOUNT SETTINGS. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE
            FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU
            FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU
            HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change in Amount Authorized. If the amount to be charged to your
            Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than
            due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes),
            you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the
            amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled
            date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment
            provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that
            we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more
            aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Auto-Renewal for Paid Services. Unless you opt out of auto-renewal,
            which can be done through your account settings, any Paid Services
            you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive
            renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term
            originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. To
            change or resign your Paid Services at any time, go to account
            settings or, for mobile applications, cancel your subscription in
            the subscription management section of the applicable App Store.If
            you terminate a Paid Service, you may use your subscription until
            the end of your then-current term, and your subscription will not be
            renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not
            be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription
            fee paid for the then-current subscription period. If you do not
            want to continue to be charged on a recurring monthly basis, you
            must cancel the applicable Paid Service through your account
            settings or terminate your Most Days account before the end of the
            recurring term. Paid Services cannot be terminated before the end of
            the period for which you have already paid, and except as expressly
            provided in these terms, Most Days will not refund any fees that you
            have already paid.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reaffirmation of Authorization. Your non-termination or continued
            use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge
            your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those
            charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges.
            This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.
            Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as
            otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid
            Service.

              From time to time, Most Days may offer free trials. Any free trial
              or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service must be
              used within the specified time of the trial. You must stop using a
              Paid Service before the end of the trial period in order to avoid
              being charged for that Paid Service. If you cancel prior to the
              end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid
              Service, please contact us at&nbsp;

          <p>
            I use the Most Days Inc. App available via the Apple App Store -

          </p>
          <p>
            These Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including our iOS

              Application infringes that third party&rsquo;s intellectual
              property rights, Most Days Inc., and not Apple, will be

              discharge of any such infringement claim;
            </li>

          </p>
          <p>

          <p>
            Arbitration Agreement. Please read the following ARBITRATION
            AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain
            disputes and claims with Most Days Inc. and limits the manner in
            which you can seek relief from Most Days Inc.. Both you and Most
            Days Inc. acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute
            arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms,
            Most Days Inc.&rsquo;s officers, directors, employees and
            independent contractors (&ldquo;Personnel&rdquo;) are third-party
            beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these
            Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have
            accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the
            third-party beneficiary hereof.
          </p>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>
              Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. The
              parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim,
              question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the
              subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith
              negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party
              initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the
              dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in the
              city and county of San Francisco. The arbitration will proceed in
              the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined
              Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the &ldquo;Rules&rdquo;) then in
              effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience
              in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract
              disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate
              list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment
              upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any
              court of competent jurisdiction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Costs of Arbitration. The Rules will govern payment of all
              arbitration fees. Most Days Inc. will pay all arbitration fees for
              claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars. Most
              Days Inc. will not seek its attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs in
              arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is
              frivolous.
            </li>
            <li>
              Small Claims Court; Infringement. Either you or Most Days Inc. may
              assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in the city
              and county of San Francisco or any United States county where you
              live or work. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing
              obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right
              to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from
              any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or
              threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a
              party&rsquo;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or
              other intellectual property rights.
            </li>
            <li>
              Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND Most Days Inc WAIVE ANY
              CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A
              TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Most Days Inc. are
              instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by
              arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited,
              more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and
              are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation
              between you and Most Days Inc. over whether to vacate or enforce
              an arbitration award, YOU AND Most Days Inc WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A
              JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a
              judge.
            </li>
            <li>
              Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES
              WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED
              OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.
              CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR
              LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER
              OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions
              is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Most Days Inc.
              is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will
              be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.
            </li>
            <li>
              Opt-out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this
              Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to
              the following address:  548 Market St
                PMB 15058
                San Francisco, CA 94104-5401 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting
              these Terms. You must include (i) your name and residence address,
              (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with
              your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out
              of these Terms&rsquo; arbitration agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
              Exclusive Venue. If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in
              any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement
              permits either you or Most Days Inc. to litigate any dispute
              arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in
              court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to
              either party, and both you and Most Days Inc. agree that any
              judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be
              brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively,
              the city and county of San Francisco, or the federal district in
              which that county falls.
            </li>
            <li>
              Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other
              claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found
              to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this
              Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void. This
              arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your
              relationship with Most Days Inc..
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Miscellaneous. You will be responsible for paying, withholding,
            filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental
            assessments associated with your activity in connection with the
            Services, provided that the Most Days Inc. may, in its sole
            discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as
            it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any
            way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further
            rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms are found to be
            unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or
            eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms
            shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You
            and Most Days Inc. agree that these Terms are the complete and
            exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Most
            Days Inc., and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous
            written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings
            relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby
            acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner,
            or joint venture of Most Days Inc., and you do not have any
            authority of any kind to bind Most Days Inc. in any respect
            whatsoever.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except as expressly set forth in the sections above regarding the
            Apple Application and the arbitration agreement, you and Most Days
            Inc. agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under
            these Terms.
